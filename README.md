# TOPOJSON

Start of an python implementation of topojson based on https://bost.ocks.org/mike/topology/ and https://github.com/topojson

The currently implemented method deviates (till know) on at least two points from the JavaScript implementation by Mike Bostocks.
1. The extraction class stores the different geometrical objects as shapely LineStrings and shapely Polygons as elements known by the keys `'lines'` and `'rings'` in the parsed dictionary. The element `'coordinates'`, which in the JavaScript code stores all the known coordinates in a list, is not included and therefor not used in further computations.
2. In the join class only the geometries that have shared paths are considered to have junctions. This means that the intersection of two crossing lines at a single coordinate is not considered as a junction. This also means that the two ends of a LineString are not automatically considered as being a junction. So if a segment starts or finish on another segment with that coordinate the only coordinate in common it is not a junction.
3. In the computation of a shared path a junction can be created even if there are no coordinates from both geometries. Maybe best explained given an example. Geometry 1 is a horizontal LineString from three coordinates [(0, 0), (3, 0) (5, 0)], the second geometry is also a horizontal LineString of three coordinates [(0, 0), (3, 0), (10, 0)]. This will result in two junctions, namely (5, 0) and (10, 0).
